Adults with dependent children applying for or receiving TCA must meet financial and technical eligibility requirements. Conditions of eligibility include cooperation with child support, participation in work activities, and compliance with substance abuse provisions. Earned and unearned income cannot exceed the benefit level paid for the assistance unit size, and assets are limited to $2,000.00.  Sanctions may be imposed for program non-compliance.

TCA is Temporary Cash Assistance. Family units can receive TCA for a total of 60 months (5 years) over a lifetime.  The program has a requirement for all applicants to seek employment.  Once an applicant begins to receive TCA, they must meet the work requirements.

This program assists families with children, who reside in the home, under age 18 or 19 and graduating in the same calendar year. The amount depends on the family's income before taxes and the number of children in the household. People receiving TCA are automatically eligible for Medical Assistance and may be eligible for Food Stamps. If a parent is absent from the household, the applicant is required to obtain a child support order against the parent. If a parent is disabled or deceased, the applicant must pursue potential income for disability or survivors benefits from the Social Security Administration.
