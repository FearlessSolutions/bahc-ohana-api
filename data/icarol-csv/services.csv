RELAY SERVICES: Maryland Relay is for anyone who wants to communicate with an individual who is deaf, hard of hearing, late-deafened, or speech disabled, and who uses a TTY (Text Telephone). The message is then skillfully relayed by an Operator (OPR), word for word, to the hearing person on the other end of the line. Then the OPR types what the hearing person has said back to the TTY user in real time. By law, each conversation is handled with the strictest confidentiality. There are no setup or monthly charges to access Maryland Relay.
 
TYPES OF RELAY CALLS:
  
VCO (Voice Carry-Over) is an option for people with hearing loss significant enough to prevent them from hearing and understanding conversations clearly through the phone. Using VCO and a specially designed telephone with a text screen, a VCO user can speak directly to the other person. As the other person speaks, the Relay Operator types back the words that are being said.

HCO (Hearing Carry-Over) is provided for people with speech disabilities. The speech-disabled person types his or her side of the telephone conversion on a TTY and the Relay Operator voices what is typed to the other person. The HCO user then listens as the other person speaks.

STS (Speech-to-Speech) is an option for people with a mild to moderate speech disability. Their words are re-voiced to the other person by a specially trained Maryland Relay Operator.

INTAKE PROCEDURE:

1) INCARCERATED CLIENT: Incarcerated clients first go through the diagnostic center at the Detention Center. After they have been classified by area of incarceration, they are interviewed to see if they are eligible for a public defender.

2) ""ON THE STREET"" CLIENT: Clients who are out on bail or on their own recognizance must contact the Public Defender's Office (see locations at end of file). They should contact the nearest office by telephone to ascertain what documentation they need to bring to the office for the interview to prove income-eligibility. The interview MUST take place at least 10 working days before the court date.

INTAKE DOCUMENTATION: Clients must bring the following documents to the interview:

1) Charging documents (summary of charges, summons).
2) Verification of income. 2 pay stubs (must be less than 30 days old).

If qualified, the client will immediately be appointed a public defender.

2) CLIENT SERVICES DIVISION:  The Public Defender refers clients who may need extra advocacy during the trial to this division. The client may have mitigating circumstances, such as a history of substance abuse, mental illness or HIV, which would suggest the need for an alternative to incarceration. The client is evaluated and, if eligible, is returned to the courtroom with an advocate and expert witnesses.
